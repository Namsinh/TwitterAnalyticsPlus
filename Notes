# for status in tweets:
        # print (status.full_text)


1. Here is what I'm thinking for this. If we do a sentiment analysis on each
tweet or on each word, we can then determine if they are positive or negative about
a particular topic, and then we can associate left, left center, right, or right center
to certain news sources or something like that.

2. Could use entity sentiment analysis too

3. Could determine the users and the content that is worst on your social media platform. Also what is
most positive. This could give users insight onto how much of their content they see is good/bad too
