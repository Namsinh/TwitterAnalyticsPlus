2. Could use entity sentiment analysis too

3. Could determine the users and the content that is worst on your social media platform. Also what is
most positive. This could give users insight onto how much of their content they see is good/bad too


Here is what I want to do:

Get all the tweets together, get each user in a dictionary with their 10 most recent tweets, and get all the users
that tweet in similar categories.

Is it going to be better to go through and grab each tweet, and if it's long enough categorize it or to take a general
sentiment analysis across multiple tweets? I think it's going to be best to go across and get categories for each tweet,
and then make a new dictionary with each value containing a list of the categories that came up. 

This is going to be easiest if I get who said what, attached with the category, attached with the tweet for each thing
